# CRM Single Calender 
In CRM we alwayz want a single calender where we can find our all work at single glance but 
their is no such process.

This solution provide single calender for  activities (appointment,phonecall,task).
You can extend the funcnality by adding more activities or entity as per your requirement. 
>It will show all these activities in single glance.
>User can open activity directly from single calnder.
>I have add this as web resource, so you can add this in Dashboard or in site map.
>It have multiple view like month, week or day.
>User can switch to today any time.
>You can extend color coding.

I have added bookable resource booking also in this calendar. 
Make if you should comment or remove ' retrieveDatabyFetch(fetchXmlBRB, "1");' function in
'crmCalender.js' web resource.
Now you can also create activities from calendar page.
