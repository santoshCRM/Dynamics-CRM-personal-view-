# Dynamics CRM: Personal-view
In CRM as a developer we alwayz want to managed Personal Viwes created by users.
But in Dyanmics CRM/365 their is no provision to see other user personal Views  and change their share properties.

I have create a plugin for Xrm toolbox.
with the help of this plugin you are able to see Personal views created by other users.
1. Install plugin to XRM tollbox.
2. Open "Personel View" plugin.
3. Click on "Retrieve Users" to get list of all users with that organization.
4. Select any user from user drop down list, it will show all "Personal view" whose owner is selected user.
5. "Double click" on  any View from that list. It will show team within user "business unit".
and user list and show all access list for that view.
6. Double click on any team or user which is not in access list, it will add user or team in access list.
7. Do required access modification in Access list.
8. Click on "Run" to submit the changes.

Note:- Remove all access from access list for particular team or user, if you want to remove share for that user or team.
